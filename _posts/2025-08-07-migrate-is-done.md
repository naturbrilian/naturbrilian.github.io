Finally, after a long time, I have almost completed the migration process from the previous website, before I found out about Infinity Free hosting by asking ChatGPT. (aww my beloved *plakkk)So, I used to use Blogger, which I initially thought was “Wow, it's great that bloggers can customize their blogs so easily + especially since I like the theme.”Actually, I used Blogger in 2014, and below that I using ameblo jp, a blogging platform from Japan, and many of my favorite musicians, including RAM WIRE, Kana Nishino, and SEAMO, also use the platform to publish their activities.

After that, starting in 2023, I began thinking about finding a website builder to replace Blogger, and then I found Wixsite, a website builder that is widely used by famous musicians, including DJs who usually go on tour or upload portfolios of their mixing work.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wixsite-web.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Then I moved all the articles I had previously created on Blogger, but what did I encounter? The free tier of Wixsite only provides 500 MB of storage. If you want more than that, you have toupgrade to the pro version. The initial goal was actually the same as with self-hosted WordPress, which is to consolidate all content so that it is not scattered. However, that was not enough, and I ultimately decided not to use this platform.

After deciding not to use Wixsite, I tried surfing to GitHub first and found a blog built using Astro. The name of the blog template is Fuwari.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/vercel-web.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Once I was satisfied, I finally used it, even though I couldn't transfer all of my content here because I had to commit one by one, memorize the code script, and so on. This blog is now archived.

And finally, there's GitHub io, which uses templates from al-folio. There are several features that I like here, such as the ability to select blog posts from external sources to display on your blog.
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/github-pages.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Unfortunately, because the process of transferring all the content took a lot of time, I ended up not using it (even though there were some features I liked). And after discovering the Infinity Free service, I decided to move it here instead. It doesn’t take as much time as the blog I mentioned earlier, and the free tier itself offers 5GB per account plus a free subdomain. You can either choose that option or connect it to your own domain. That’s about it, and the blog I didn’t end up using will likely be deleted.

Oh yes, another note that I like about WordPress self-hosting is that you don't need to create duplicate posts to make posts in different languages. You just need to install a plugin TranslatePress from the catalog.

# The reason for making this content into one
Well, previously I placed other content on Google Sites, which was mainly my portfolio and other things, and that's when I thought of combining all the content so that it wouldn't be scattered.
