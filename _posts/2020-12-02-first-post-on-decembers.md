Yes, because I don’t know what to write, so what do I want to type in here hahaha.

It seems that it has been 1 month since I haven’t written an article here because of a busy life in the real life, And the fun of playing your favorite games, how are you, your gacha, you will definitely get SSR right?

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ssr-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/ssr-2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Incidentally, last night they got them … uh, it’s not because of the gacha, but we used the “chooseable character” ticket so I choose them, wow. How’s the gacha in the next game? no need to ask hahaha

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/priconne-gacha.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
