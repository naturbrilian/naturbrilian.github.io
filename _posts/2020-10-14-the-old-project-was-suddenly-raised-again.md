# Somehow this morning I even wrote an article, I haven’t even slept at all.
So yesterday afternoon, after uploading the work that I announced yesterday on the blog, i usually close my deviantart account right away, but I took the time to check notifications on my account. Suddenly a user commented on my post 2 years ago.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/comment.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Yes, surely you know the anime “Darling in the franxx” which was popular at that time? I had time to make the theme, starting from Windows theme until I made this “Winrar Themes”

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/post.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Maybe if someone likes it I put it below for the download link. Maybe I have plans to make it again, but who knows when because there is no intention and lack of material.

# The download link for the above theme is here:
[Darling in the franxx Winrar Theme by gingalibadeidara on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/gingalibadeidara/art/Darling-in-the-franxx-Winrar-Theme-759186201) that’s all for today’s article, today the writer hasn’t slept yet and didn’t realize it was morning, gosh. *plaaak instead confide in.
