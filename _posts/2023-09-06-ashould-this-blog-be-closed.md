Hello, as in the title above, I as the owner of this blog will probably not continue writing on the English version of the blog because I only want to focus on the Indonesian Blog. In the future, perhaps all of these articles will be moved to the Indonesian blog, but only a few have been moved. On the Japanese version of the blog, I no longer continue my writing & I have closed it. Because I only want to focus on the two language versions. However, don’t worry, the main blog is still continuing, but more on project announcements. With this, yesterday’s tutorial article is the last post on this blog & thank you for visiting.
