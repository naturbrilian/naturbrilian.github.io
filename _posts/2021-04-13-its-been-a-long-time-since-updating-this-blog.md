Hi, hello I’m back * sleepy expression, I think I haven’t updated the posts here for a long time. Oh, yes before that I apologize, because I am also managing the blog for the Indonesian version, well, instead I have a little tutorial here, even though the video is a long duration.

ou can see the tutorial via the following link:  [https://youtu.be/Mjbc3DS50SQ](https://youtu.be/Mjbc3DS50SQ) Actually I want to stop making the background vector background a trivial matter

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20210413035554.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/stop.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Now, I don’t know … it needs to be continued or it will stop here, considering the many handsome characters, one of them is:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20210413035829.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
