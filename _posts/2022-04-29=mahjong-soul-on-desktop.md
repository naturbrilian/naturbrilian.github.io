> Additional notes, this tutorial is very old and maybe not working for now, because official client is available on official website.

here I will show you how to install and play one of the games that are currently being played by my friends or myself. Call it “Mahjong Soul” but on desktop like Princess Connect Re: Dive or another Anime Games (Granblue Fantasy)
What do you need to run this? Yes, you need software called NodeJs, so you can download via this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_tCwoeuBBPZA8hNxbzIsmmQ.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

Install as usual (because here I have installed it, so I just skip it). Download the repository via the following link and extract it anywhere.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/20220429093131.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_5YojCTVIxJjBejTjy3z7LA.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

After extracting all the files, run a terminal windows or cmd in the folder like this.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_h1lkIt_pHpiyUSYfGi6mQg.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

so type command line on cmd npm install like this and just wait untill process done.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_-8WfyGF2ppQ6VxvaummVTA.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

when finished for the installation, you just type npm start to start game

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_n-m-TH40QQVTHVyLaSHHfw.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

tadaa~ you can enjoy the game without open your browser

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/1_5eNT2-QM5dKVyQrSlWYR1Q.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
